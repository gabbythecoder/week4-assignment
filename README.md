## Requirements
- 🎯 Ensure your HTML form is working and submitting data into the database as expected.
- 🎯 Confirm that your project is functional on multiple screen sizes using either Responsive Design or media queries.
- 🎯 Create a working GET API route in your server.
- 🎯 Create a working POST API route in your client.
- 🎯 Seed your database with realistic-looking ‘dummy’ data through the Supabase query editor or a seed file in your server. Ensure that this is saved and submitted (in a screenshot or seed file form) so it can be marked and tested efficiently.
